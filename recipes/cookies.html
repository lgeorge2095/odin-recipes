            When you want cookies, you want cookies. If you're like me and love all types of cookies
            then this basic sugar cookie recipe is perfect. You can top them with any kind of frosting
            that you please or even something different like honey or peanut butter. This recipe will make
            roughly 18 cookies depending on how large they are. Super yummy and easy!
